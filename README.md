# Defender (1981) - Web Version

This is a web-based version of the classic arcade game Defender, originally released by Williams Electronics in 1981. This version allows you to play the game directly in your web browser.

## Setup Instructions

1. Build the ROM files:
   ```bash
   make redlabel
   ```
   This will create the ROM files in the `redlabel` directory.

2. Copy the ROM files:
   ```bash
   cp redlabel/defend.* roms/
   ```

3. Serve the web files:
   You can use any web server to serve the files. For example, using Python's built-in HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Controls

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Move left/right
- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Thrust up/down
- **Space**: Fire
- **1**: Start Game

## Technical Details

This web version uses:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- WebAssembly for running the MAME emulator core
- JavaScript for game logic and input handling

## Original Source

This web version is based on the original Defender source code, which can be found in the `src` directory. The original source code was written in Motorola 6809 assembly language and was designed to run on the Williams arcade hardware.

This is the source code for the Williams arcade game Defender.

The source code can be assembled into the 11 rom files that would have been
loaded onto the arcade cabinet's ROM board. Today, these rom files can be used
to play the game in an emulator such as
[MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html).

## Build Instructions

### Build Requirements
```sh
sudo apt install build-essential wine python3 flex
```

### Build the assembler toolchain

We use [`asm6809`](https://www.6809.org.uk/asm6809/) to assembler the source code for the main game and [`vasm`](http://www.compilers.de/vasm.html) to compile
the sound module. 

First you must run the following to set up the git submodules containing the assembler toolchain:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Now you can build the toolchain, as follows:

```sh
cd asm6809
./autogen.sh
./configure
make 
cd ..
cd vasm-mirror
make CPU=6800 SYNTAX=oldstyle
cd ..
```

### Build Defender

To build the Red Label rom files (see below for more information on what these are), do:
```sh
make redlabel
```
These will get written to a directory called `redlabel`.

## Play Defender

Once you've built defender you can now use the rom files in the `redlabel` directory to play defender on [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html). If you're on Ubuntu you can also install MAME with apt:
```sh
sudo apt install mame
```

## Notes on the Source Code, ROM Files, and the Physical Circuit Boards

### About the source code
The game source code for Defender in [src](src) was originally retrieved from
https://github.com/historicalsource/defender. It is the Motorola 6809 assembly language
source code for the 'Red Label' version of the game.

The source code for the [sound module](src/vsndrm1.src) was retrieved from https://github.com/historicalsource/williams-soundroms.

There were four versions of the game released:
White Label, Blue Label, Green Label, and Red Label, in that order. Each
release was a circuit board with the assembled code split across a number of
different ROM chips, also referred to as 'ICs'. This image of the Red Label ROM
board from [Scott Tunstall's
site](https://www.robotron-2084.co.uk/techwilliamshardwareid.html) gives you an
idea of what such a board looks like:

<img src="orig/D8572.jpg" size=250> <img src="orig/RedLabelROMBoardSchema.png" size=250>

If you compare this image to [the file listing for the Red Label
roms](orig/defender-redlabel) you'll notice that the missing chip on the board
corresponds to a missing file `defend.5`:
```sh
[robert@mwenge-desktop defender-redlabel (master)]$ ls -al
total 64
drwxrwxr-x 2 robert robert 4096 Jul 11 10:32 .
drwxrwxr-x 8 robert robert 4096 Jul 11 11:02 ..

-rw-rw-r-- 1 robert robert 2048 Dec 24  1996 defend.8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 robert robert 2048 Dec 24  1996 defend.9
```

So each file `defend.[x]` corresponds to a matching chip on the board and
because there is a missing chip in slot 5 we have no `defend.5` in the rom dump
listing.

In the [Defender product documentation](https://www.robotron-2084.co.uk/manuals/defender/defender_later_pcb_drawing_set.pdf) a 
chart lists the part numbers for each chip and confirms that IC5 (i.e. `defend.5`) is unused:

<img src="orig/RedLabelROMChart.png" size="300">

When we assemble the Defender source with `make redlabel` we create a bunch of
object files and then split them across the 11 files to match the 11 in the Red
Label ROM dump listing above.

Eugene Jarvis left a slightly cryptic note to how we assemble the source in [`info.src`](src/info.src):

```
 TO ASSEMBLE THE DEFENDER MESS

RASM PHR2,DEFA2,DEFB2,AMODE0;-X (ELSE CREF SYMBOL OVERFLOW)
RASM PHR2,SAMEXPA7
RASM PHR2,DEFA2,DEFB2
TO GET THE DIAGS, CHAIN ALL.CF
LOAD IT ALL AND THEN PRAY IT WORKS
(NOTE: BEWARE OF ORDER OF LOADING
       LOOK OUT FOR THE SELECTED BLOCK SHIT

DR J. 1/21/81

```

Since the `RASM` assembler is no longer available to us we use [`asm6809`](asm6809) instead. Fortunately this
does a good job of assembling the source faithfully and [only very minor modifications to the source files are
required to produce binaries](#changes-required-for-the-source-to-assemble). We recreate the steps in Eugene's notes as follows:

```
	# Build amode1 # The equivalent of: RASM PHR2,DEFA2,DEFB2,AMODE0;-X (ELSE CREF SYMBOL OVERFLOW)
	./asm6809/src/asm6809 -B src/phr6.src src/defa7.src src/defb6.src src/amode1.src\
	 		-l bin/defa7-defb6-amode1.lst  -o bin/defa7-defb6-amode1.o
```
This is the main game code with the attract mode module assembled in. `phr6.src` is a file containing definitions,
while `defa7.src` and `defb6/src` contain the main game code; `amode1.src` contains the attract mode code.

We also have to build a version of this game code without the attract mode module:

```

	# Build defa7 and defb6
	# The equivalent of: RASM PHR2,DEFA2,DEFB2
	./asm6809/src/asm6809 -B src/phr6.src src/defa7.src src/defb6.src\
 			-l bin/defa7-defb6.lst -o bin/defa7-defb6.o
```

The final module the notes mention is `samexpa7` a bunch of explosion routines added by Sam Dicker:

```
	# Build samexamp
	# The equivalent of: RASM PHR2,SAMEXPA7
	./asm6809/src/asm6809 -B src/phr6.src src/samexap7.src\
	    -l bin/samexap7.lst -o bin/samexap7.o
```

Eugene's notes are much less clear on how we go about assembling the reamining source files:

```
mess0.src
blk71.src
romf8.src
romc0.src
romc8.src
```

However the way he lists them in the notes turns out to provide a clue to the order in which they
shoud be assembled:

```
PHR6.SRC	  636 LINES
DEFA7.SRC	3,375 LINES
DEFB6.SRC	2,252 LINES
AMODE1.SRC	1,310 LINES
BLK71.SRC	  723 LINES
SAMEXAP7.SRC	  382 LINES
MESS0.SRC	  955 LINES
ROMF8.SRC	  692 LINES
ROMC0.SRC	  925 LINES
ROMC8.SRC	  839 LINES
```

We assemble the last four together in the order that they appear above:

```
	# Build roms
	./asm6809/src/asm6809 -B src/mess0.src src/romf8.src src/romc0.src src/romc8.src\
	 		-l bin/roms.lst -o bin/roms.o
```

And we assemble `blk71.src` by itself:

```
	# Build blk71
	./asm6809/src/asm6809 -B src/blk71.src -l bin/blk71.lst -o bin/blk71.o
```

### ROM Part Table with Corresponding Assembled Object Files

IC12|A5343-09645 |defend.12|bin/defa7-defb6-amode1.o|0xaee9|0x0117

Replicating this arrangement of the binaries is achieved by [`ChainFilesToRom.py`](ChainFilesToRom.py) in the 
project's [Makefile](Makefile). It's a simple python script that extracts the relevant segments from each of the
binaries built in the `bin` folder when you run `make redlabel`.

### Changes required for the source to assemble
There were a few modifications to the source required along the way to get this to work.

1. Replacing macro arguments to make them compatible `asm6809`,e.g.:
```diff
-NAPP    MACRO  \0,\1
-        LDA    #\0
-        LDX    #\1
+NAPP    MACRO  \1,\2
+        LDA    #\1
+        LDX    #\2
         JMP    SLEEPP
         ENDM 
```

2. Replacing the use of `$` in label names, e.g.:
```diff
-INIT$V  EQU    HOFV+2
-HALLDV  EQU    INIT$V+2
+INITSSV  EQU    HOFV+2
+HALLDV  EQU    INITSSV+2
```
3. Replacing the use of '.' in label names, e.g.:
```diff
-        LDY    #.P1SCR          ;START WITH PLAYER 1
+        LDY    #P1SCR           ;START WITH PLAYER 1
```

4.  Work around the fact that `RASM` seems to have allowed you to assemble code sections into overlapping
memory segments. For example both `amode1.src` and `defa7.src` want to assemble into position `$C000` in
the ROM, meaning that one will overwrite the other. This explains why the main game files get assembled
twice, once with attract mode (`amode1.src`) and once without: they wanted a binary with some segments
overwritten with attract mode features and one without. We achieve this ourselves by modifying the source
to assemble and place the attract mode code to position `$2000` in memory, and when we later split the
object files into the `defend.x` files pick the chunk of code we're interested in:
```diff

10. This one may be worth investingating further. The code references `P1LAS` when it needs to be `P1LAT` to match
the Red Label binaries. Would be interesting to know if this sheds any light on the version of the source code as it
looks very like a typo that was bug-fixed.

13. `blk71.src` has to be assembled with 6309 extensions and `STX [,Y]` has to be changed to the `COMF' instruction
in order to get it to match with the ROM binaries.
